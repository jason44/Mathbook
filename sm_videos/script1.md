# A
We begin with a general form to represent the quadratic
Remember from our previous example that a and b represents the coefficients of the 
first two terms and c is a constant

Moving on, we want to isolate the terms with the variable and we will also want to divide both sides by 
the coefficient of the x^2 term, a.

	Now, we want to add a number q, so that the left hand side of the 
	equation can be squared

	And this is also why we first divide the equation by a. 
	Notice that if we didn't divide the equation by a first, we would have to 
	modify the the x-term as well. But since we did divide by a, we've simplified
	the problem into finding a single number, q. 

	But what is q exactly. Going back to the previous example, we found our 
	constant by dividing the x-term's coefficient by 2 and squaring the quotient
	
	Remember, we divided the equation by a, so the correct value for q then, is 
	b over 2a, squared. 

	And this makes perfect sense. Remember that in the process of foiling a perfect
	square, we end up with a constant that is always the square of half of the coefficient of the second term

	Now that we know what number to add into the equation, deriving the formula is rather straightforward.
	We begin by getting common denominators. Then we factor the left hand side into a square. After that, just 
	isolate x and we get the quadratic formula that we all know and love.
